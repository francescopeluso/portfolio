# My portfolio website

👨🏻‍💻 Made with TypeScript and ReactJS. Hosted on Vercel. \
⚛️ This is just a "first approach" to using React.

🤧 I wrote the whole thing in a couple of days while I was sick, lol.

🤗 Any contribution is welcome, also, the portfolio is available [here](https://www.francescopeluso.xyz).
